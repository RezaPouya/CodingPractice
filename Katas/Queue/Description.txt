Implement your own queue (existing .NET implementations are not allowed (list, array, …)).

    The queue should have the following methods:
    Enqueue(object): Adds an element to the queue.
    Dequeue(): Returns the first element and removes it from the queue.
    Peek(): Returns the first element without removing it.
