Stack

Implement your own stack (existing .NET implementations are not allowed (list, array, …)

The stack should have the following methods:

    Push(object): Adds an element to the stack.
    Pop(): Returns the last element and removes it from the stack.
    Peek(): Returns the last element without removing it.
